### 10 times 10-fold cross-validation
]

.right-column[
A one-time 10-fold cross-validation works as the following:

- Ten labeled train/test set pairs are generated.

- Train a classifier with an algorithm from a train set containing 90% labeled data from the entire input. Test the classifier performance using the rest 10% data which is the test set.

- Repeat step 2 with the 2nd to 10th train/test set pairs.

- Take the average performance as output.

This is repeated 10 times to make sure our results are statistically significant.

.right-column[

* Bayesian algorithms are vulnerable to noise. They lose a bit accuracy after the feature vector length is larger than 400.

* Some machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, tend to ignore the negative impacts of noise. The accuracy do not drop when lots of noises are added. It does not goes any higher either.

* The highest accuracy (.red[97%]) is achieved by BayesNet with a very short feature vector length of around .red[70].

* Most algorithms peak at [250,300].
Several tree-based algorithms step up a lot from 260 to 270.

  * Therefore .red[270] appears to be an optimal choice.

.right-column[

* BayesNet provides highest accuracy.

* Tree-based algorithms are fast. They are optimal with 270-dimensional feature.

* AI algorithms (abandoned during algorithm selection phase) are a order of magnitude slower. They do not, however, provide lower error.

* Wrong cases will be inspected to find outliers or to improve current models.
